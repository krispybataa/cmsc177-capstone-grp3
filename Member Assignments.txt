	For sources: Use the IEEE citation-generator and keep track of where/what its supposed to cite 
		We have to order the citations by number and the corresponding number to the respectrive citation 
		I suggest using comment in the docs wherever a citation is supposed to go (select the last word, and Google-Commet the citation)
